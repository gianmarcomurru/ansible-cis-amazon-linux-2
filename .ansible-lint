# Ansible-lint is able to recognize and load skip rules stored inside

# like "playbook.yml package-latest" on a new line. Optionally you can add
# comments after the tag, prefixed by "#". We discourage the use of skip_list
# below because that will hide violations from the output. When putting ignores
# inside the ignore file, they are marked as ignored, but still visible, making
# it easier to address later.
